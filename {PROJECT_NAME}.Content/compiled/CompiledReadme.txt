This is the location where you cross-compile assets for various different
platforms.  See http://protogame.org/docs/asset_management.html#compiling_assets
for more information about compiling assets.

We've included compiled versions of the assets for Android; if you change the source
assets and you are targeting a mobile platform, you'll need to recompile the assets
before running the game.
