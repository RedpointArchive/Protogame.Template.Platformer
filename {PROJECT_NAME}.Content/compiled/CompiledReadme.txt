This is the location where you cross-compile assets for various different
platforms.  See https://protogame.readthedocs.org/en/latest/assets/compiling_assets.html
for more information about compiling assets.

We've included compiled versions of the assets for Android; if you change the source
assets and you are targeting a mobile platform, you'll need to recompile the assets
before running the game.
